# Maze-Escape
In this game your goal is to escape from a labyrinth. The maze is filled with walls, coins, portals, a key, a treasure and an enemy that chases you. To win, you must open the treasure using the key. Collect as many coins as possible - you can buy lives with them later. Be careful - the enemy always takes the shortest path to you and makes move/moves every time you move. However, it can't teleport - use this to your advantage. The number of enemy moves depends on the game level. Don't step on walls - it will cost you one life. If you lose all your lives or get caught by the enemy, you lose the game and the coins you've collected. Climb the leaderboard by passing levels and collecting as many coins as possible (the players on the leaderboard are sorted in descending order by level, coins and lives). The higher the level you reach, the bigger the labyrinth will become, and so will the prize. You can always view your account info (name, level, lives, coins) or sign out and then log in/sign up again. Keep in mind each username must be unique (case-insensitive). If you need to quit a game, don't worry - your progress will be saved and when you decide to play that level again you will have the chance to resume from where you left off.
